## Description

This application saves a developer valuable time when working on a project by generating the markdown syntax for a professional README file.  The file is created after a developer answers a series of questions.  

- This project helped me further develop my skills using API requests and asynchronous JavaScript. 
- I was able to demonstrate my understanding of arrow functions, template literals, and array destructuring.   
- The list of licenses is retrieved from GitHub's API and will stay up to date with common licenses.  
- Improving my focus on the DRY principle of coding was a large focus for this project.
